# UNVEILING FILM TASTES: A PERSONALIZED MOVIE JOURNEY THROUGH SMART     RECOMMENDATIONS

# OVERVIEW
This project centers on enhancing the user experience on movie streaming platforms by constructing a sophisticated recommendation system that aligns closely with individual preferences. In the era of digital streaming dominance, the sheer abundance of movies poses a challenge for users in navigating through the vast catalogs to find content tailored to their tastes. The recommendation system becomes a crucial element, acting as a guide in this cinematic maze. Recognizing the inherently personal nature of people's movie preferences, the project seeks to predict and suggest movies based on users' past viewing history and ratings, as well as the preferences of users with similar tastes. The ultimate goal is to streamline content discovery, making it easier for users to find and enjoy films that resonate with their unique preferences.

The significance of such a recommendation system extends beyond user satisfaction to contribute to increased retention and revenue for the streaming platform. Leveraging real-time datasets from platforms like movielens, the analysis delves into various user interactions, ratings, and viewing patterns. By building a model that resonates with the diverse preferences of the audience, the project aims to create a personalized and enjoyable cinematic journey for each user. Aligning with three primary objectives—Enhance User Experience, Increase User Retention, and Drive Revenue—the project is poised to revolutionize the way users engage with cinematic content, fostering a stronger and more satisfying connection between users and the streaming platform.

# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
The film industry boasts of a vast array of genres, ranging from action and drama to comedy, science fiction, horror, and beyond. Each genre caters to distinct tastes and moods, offering a rich tapestry of cinematic experiences. While this diversity is an advantage for movie enthusiasts, it also poses a challenge—the dilemma of choosing the perfect film from the extensive selection.
For users, navigating through this abundance of options can be a daunting task. The sheer volume of movies available makes decision-making overwhelming, especially when the goal is to ensure not just any watch but an enjoyable and satisfying cinematic experience. Consequently, businesses operating in this industry must delve into the complexities of user preferences to provide tailored recommendations and enhance the overall movie-watching experience.

# DATA UNDERSTANDING
The dataset for this project, acquired from movielens using the small dataset to accommodate computational limitations, encompasses four key files: Movies.csv, Links.csv, Ratings.csv, and Tags.csv. These datasets collectively offer comprehensive information about movies, including details on movie identifiers, external references, user ratings, and additional tags. The common identifier, movieId, facilitates merging, resulting in a consolidated dataframe with 285,783 rows and 11 columns, combining numerical variables such as movieID, imdbID, tmdbID, UserID_X, timestamp_x, UserID_y, timestamp_y, and rating, along with categorical variables like title, genre, and tag.

In-depth preprocessing steps were applied to the dataset to address missing values, outliers, duplicates, inconsistent genres, and optimize memory usage. Imputation strategies were employed for missing values, outlier detection was recommended for further investigation, and inconsistent genres were manually standardized. Memory optimization involved converting object-type columns to categories, reducing the dataset's memory footprint. The resulting dataset, after preprocessing, appears promising for building a recommendation system, boasting completeness, diverse user interactions, valuable timestamp information, a positively skewed rating distribution, genre details for content-based recommendations, and consistent user and movie IDs. This lays a robust foundation for subsequent exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development, aligning with the project's objectives to enhance user experience, increase retention, and drive revenue on movie streaming platforms.

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the movie dataset unveils key trends and insights critical for the development of an effective movie recommendation system. The positively skewed distribution of ratings, predominantly falling between 3.8 and 5.0, suggests a generally favorable sentiment among users. Identification of top-performing genres, such as Comedy, Crime, Drama, Thriller, and Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi, offers valuable genre preferences that resonate well with the audience. Temporal patterns in movie production, notably the peak in the 1990s followed by a decline, highlight the importance of adapting recommendation models to evolving user preferences over time. Insights into user engagement through high-rated movies, coupled with the recognition of user-generated metadata like tags, provide opportunities for enhancing the recommendation system by incorporating evolving user interactions. The EDA underscores the significance of high ratings and user engagement for revenue generation and user retention, offering actionable strategies for prioritizing content and improving the overall cinematic experience. The pragmatic use of dimensionality reduction through PCA further ensures computational efficiency without compromising essential information for modeling.

# MODELING
In this feature engineering and collaborative filtering endeavor, a 'userId' column is ingeniously crafted by amalgamating 'ratings_userId' and 'tags_userId,' serving as the pivot for the user-item matrix. Collaborative filtering with KNN is selected as the foundational model, valued for its simplicity and effectiveness, particularly suited for moderate-sized datasets. The user-item matrix, pivotal in collaborative filtering, unveils unexpected recommendations while addressing the sparsity challenge by transforming it into a memory-efficient CSR matrix. The modeling journey unfolds with Funk SVD, yielding a commendable RMSE of 0.7462, followed by item-item collaborative filtering focusing on duplicate handling and distinct movie recommendations. User-item collaborative filtering, featuring SVD, refines the RMSE to 0.7423. The introduction of Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) showcases deep learning prowess, and meticulous tuning results in a test loss of 0.54, reflecting robust generalization to unseen data. This holistic approach encompasses traditional and advanced collaborative filtering techniques, emphasizing model interpretability, predictive accuracy, and strategies to combat overfitting, providing a comprehensive understanding of recommendation systems with applicability to both accuracy and scalability considerations.

# CONCLUSION
The recommendation system has achieved a 74% accuracy in aligning user preferences with movie recommendations. This addresses the challenge of content navigation challenges by delivering tailored movie suggestions ultimately improving the watching experience. An accurate recommendation system contributes significantly to user contentment and the platform's success. By streamlining movie searches and maximizing content enjoyment, personalized recommendations improve efficiency and foster loyalty. Users who consistently find appealing content are more likely to stay engaged and loyal, ensuring long-term user retention and platform prosperity.
